# YoutubeSummaryBot
This code uses OpenAI to create summaries for a list of youtube videos

To use it:
Add your OpenAI API KEY into your environment variables under the description "OPEN_API_KEY"

Then run the youTube_Summary.py
The code will scrape the transcript from the youTube video and then provide a "key learnings" summary as well as a a list of key words and embeddings.

This project is designed to be added to an Autogen project to build expert Agents using Youtube.
